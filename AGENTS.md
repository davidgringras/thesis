# Agent Instructions

This repository contains Brier and the Thesis forecasting app. Future agents
should treat this file as the operating entrypoint.

## Read First

Before changing forecast-generation, pack, resolution, scoring, or agent-run
surfaces, read these in order:

1. `docs/thesis-vision.md` - mission, scope, non-goals, prioritization.
2. `docs/cell-contract.md` - forecast-cell schema and trace-depth bar.
3. `docs/thesis-analyst-runner.md` - how live agent runs become records.
4. `docs/brier-lab.md` - reward export, splits, and scoring loop.
5. `agents/thesis-analyst/system.md` - analyst method and honesty rules.

For UI work, also inspect the existing page/component before editing; preserve
the utilitarian forecast-lab feel.

## North Star

Thesis is an open-source, agent-only forecasting lab for automatically
resolvable public-data series. Brier is the forecast-accuracy agent trained and
evaluated on Thesis records.

Optimize for:

- more official-series forecasts that resolve mechanically;
- complete public activity traces;
- run comparison across agents, prompt modes, and pack sets;
- automatic resolution and proper scoring;
- reproducibility over hand-authored polish.

## Hard Constraints

- Do not turn Thesis into a human prediction market.
- Do not add forecasts that require subjective adjudication unless they are
  outside the core Brier training loop.
- Do not hand-edit generated forecast modules except to wire generated output
  into the catalog after review.
- Do not collapse full activity into a summary. Preserve prompt, command,
  stdout/stderr, raw response, parsed/normalized cells, validation, manifest,
  resolution event, and score where available.
- Do not infer `resolutionDate` from cadence. Verify it from an official
  calendar, schedule, release placeholder, or policy-state rule.
- Do not use FRED or news as the final resolution source when an official
  agency source exists. FRED can be a history mirror.
- Do not silently clean failed agent runs into successful ones. Failed traces
  are useful records.

## Common Tasks

### Add Or Run Forecasts

Use the thesis analyst runner:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python scripts/run_thesis_analyst.py \
  --series ons.labour.unemployment_rate \
  --period 2026-Q4 \
  --prompt-mode fast \
  --command "/Users/maxghenis/.bun/bin/codex --search exec --ignore-user-config -m gpt-5.5 -c 'service_tier=\"fast\"' --sandbox read-only -C {repo_root} -"
```

Use `--prompt-mode fast` for high-volume public-release batches. Use full
prompt mode when auditing or improving the agent method.

After a successful run:

1. Inspect `manifest.json`, `validation.json`, and `normalized_cells.json`.
2. Keep failed runs in `records/thesis-analyst/...`.
3. Promote successful runs through a generator, not by hand-pasting JSON.
4. Verify the detail page, log page, and Brier reward export if the run is
   wired into the UI.

### Add comparison runs

Strategy comparisons are published only through the dispatch-only strategy
docket. The workflow selects open, already-published targets with trusted
checkout code, runs the requested ladder and/or median-of-three suite without a
write token, and lets a separate publisher validate the exact data bundle and
regenerate the complete comparison file:

```bash
gh workflow run strategy-docket.yml --ref main \
  -f catalog_slugs=australia-cpi-annual-rate-july-2026 \
  -f auto_select=false \
  -f max_targets=1 \
  -f suite=both
```

`suite=ladder` runs reviewed threshold-ladder elicitation. `suite=median3`
runs three independent fast rollouts and derives their deterministic median
CDF. `suite=both` runs both interventions. The selector rejects unknown,
unpublished, resolved, and release-day targets.

`ladder_prompt_mode` picks the ladder lane's elicitation contract and is
bound into the trusted selection (never a generate-job input). `ladder`
(default) is the v1 contract: identical ladder elicitation plus the
fast-mode sigma discipline — the math step must state "sigma = X" (or the
1.28 z-multiplier) and compare the ladder-implied 80% width against
1.28*sigma. `ladder_v2` (pre-registered 2026-07-10) is the quantile-native
contract: the same ladder elicitation and structural gates, but the
machine-checkable width derivation is the ladder itself — the math step
must list the "P(X <= t) = p" rungs and state the interpolated 10th and
90th percentiles literally, with no parametric sigma disclosure demanded.
Motivation: the 2026-07-10 model wave showed gpt-5.6-luna/-terra producing
complete quantile-inversion derivations while failing the sigma idiom
0/12, versus gpt-5.5's 6/6; running the same models under both contracts
separates capability from idiom compliance. Runs seal their promptMode
into the cell, land as a distinct agent (`thesis.analyst.ladder_v2`), and
are validated mode-aware in both `scripts/spawned_cells_to_ts.py` and
`site/src/__tests__/trace-depth.test.ts`.

Do not run strategy batches locally and push their records or generated
TypeScript to `main`. `scripts/strategy_comparisons.py` is a trusted publisher
generator over the complete indexed strategy corpus; it is not an authority
for bypassing the select → generate → publish boundary. If units differ
between a run and its catalog target, encode the conversion in the trusted
target or generator mapping so comparisons render in the catalog unit.

### Add Or Change Packs

Packs are forecasting interventions, not generic markdown skills. A pack page
should explain what the pack changes in the forecast process and show where it
is used. Do not repeat a meta-definition of packs on every individual pack
page.

Useful pack comparisons show at least:

- no-pack/control run;
- pack-enabled run;
- point and interval shift;
- trace or reasoning difference;
- eventual score difference when resolved.

### Verify Challenge Submissions

External forecasts arrive as PRs adding
`challenge/inbox/<github-login>/<cell>.json`, optionally signed with
Sigstore keyless (a `<cell>.json.sigstore.json` sidecar; see
`docs/challenge-signing.md`). Before publishing any of them, sweep the
inbox:

```bash
uv run --extra challenge python scripts/verify_challenge_signatures.py
```

Unsigned submissions are valid — signing is optional. A
present-but-invalid bundle, an orphan bundle, or any unexpected inbox
file must fail the sweep and must never be published. The publish adapter
stores each verified signature's `thesis_challenge_signature_v1` block
(from `--json`) alongside the merge SHA it already records. Submitter
signing distributes proof, never signing authority: publish-side signing
stays CI-only and challenger PRs never touch `records/**`.

### Work On Resolution Or Scoring

Resolution and scoring code should preserve these invariants:

- splits are by `resolutionDate`, not run order;
- unresolved rows have null reward;
- resolved rows link to official observations;
- training cannot see future official outcomes;
- reward rows include provenance hashes and activity-artifact count.

## Verification

For Python runner changes:

```bash
uv run --extra dev ruff check scripts/run_thesis_analyst.py scripts/thesis_records_to_comparisons.py tests/test_thesis_analyst_runner.py tests/test_thesis_analyst_env_hygiene.py
uv run --extra dev pytest tests/test_thesis_analyst_runner.py tests/test_thesis_analyst_env_hygiene.py
```

For site changes:

```bash
cd site
bun run test
bun run build
```

After meaningful frontend changes, verify the affected localhost pages in the
in-app browser.

For docs-only changes, at minimum run:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Definition Of Done

A change is not done until:

- the relevant docs or generated artifacts are updated;
- validation catches bad cells rather than allowing weak traces through;
- the UI shows the new run/comparison/resolution where appropriate;
- the Brier reward export still builds;
- tests or a clear reason for not running tests are reported.

When in doubt, choose the path that increases the number of automatically
resolvable, fully traced, scored public-data forecasts.

### Records provenance (workflow attestations)

### The records-path guard (run this in every clone)

`records/**` belongs to the allowlisted workflows: they attest every push,
and the provenance audit fails main for any records commit that lacks one.
GitHub cannot enforce this server-side — public source repositories cannot
carry push rulesets at all (verified 2026-07-25: the API refuses with
"Source public repos cannot have push rules"), so the preventive half is a
committed pre-push hook. Activate it once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

It refuses any local push that touches `records/**`, prints the offending
paths, and can be overridden deliberately with
`THESIS_ALLOW_RECORDS_PUSH=1` — an override that still lands unattested and
still costs a permanent public waiver. Six such waivers already exist
(`WAIVED_UNATTESTED_COMMITS`); each one is an admission, not an exemption.

Every workflow that pushes `records/**` to `main` attests a canonical
subject naming the pushed commit (`scripts/attest_subject.py`, via the
composite action `.github/actions/attest-records-push`, Sigstore/GitHub
artifact attestations). `scripts/verify_records_attestations.py` — run by
`.github/workflows/records-provenance.yml` on every push and on a daily
audit — fails when any records commit after the enforcement epoch lacks a
valid attestation from an allowlisted publishing workflow on
`refs/heads/main`. The epoch is self-anchoring: the commit that introduced
the verifier script.

This binds each records commit to an allowlisted workflow run that
asserted the push (Sigstore proves the run attested the subject; push
causality follows from the workflow logic, which attests only after its
own ref advancement). It complements the RFC 3161 witness chain (when)
with workflow identity (who/how), and makes the "never push records from
a local checkout" rule mechanical: a local push turns `records-provenance`
red on its next run.

Honest limits: this is a detective control. The verifier, subject builder,
composite action, and workflows live in the same mutable `main` they
guard — an actor with direct write access could alter the control files
before pushing unsigned records, and force-pushes could remove an unsigned
commit before the daily audit sees it. Branch rulesets (no force pushes;
required review or CODEOWNERS on `.github/workflows/**` and the
provenance scripts) are the containment for that class and are a
repository-settings decision. Repository administration remains outside
the control's reach entirely.

Third parties should check records commits by running
`scripts/verify_records_attestations.py` itself — it is era-aware.
Commits signed before the 2026-07-22 transfer (MaxGhenis/brier →
ThesisInstitute/thesis) carry the old slug in their subject bytes and
certificate, and their attestations live in GitHub's OWNER-keyed store
under `--owner MaxGhenis`, not under the current repo; every acceptance
additionally requires the certificate to name the immutable repository
id 1113415529. A manual `gh attestation verify --repo
ThesisInstitute/thesis` therefore works only for post-transfer commits,
and five 2026-07-2x commits are permanently waived as unattested local
pushes (`WAIVED_UNATTESTED_COMMITS` in the verifier — a public admission
list, separate by design from `waivers.json`'s grandfather sets, which
cover data-shape grandfathering rather than provenance misses).

### Waiver ratchet

`waivers.json` enumerates every grandfather set — pre-cutover v1/v2
registration snapshots, docket series without a committed sourceBinding
template, legacy-incomplete custody roots — and
`tests/test_waiver_ratchet.py` recomputes each population from live state on
every CI run. A population that exceeds its manifest fails the build:
exceptions shrink over time or grow only through a deliberate, reviewable
edit to `waivers.json`, never silently. (Pattern adapted from Axiom's
validation-waiver ratchet.)
